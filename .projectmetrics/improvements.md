## LLM Context Points

1. The extension now directly uses the working extension's approach for accessing WhatsApp Web's internal APIs:
   - Uses the WhatsApp Web Package Provider (WPP) object to access internal functions
   - Directly injects proven script that has robust media sending functionality
   - Maintains clear communication channels between content script and injected script

2. Key technical improvements:
   - Completely eliminated all experimental approaches in favor of proven methods
   - Removed adapter pattern in favor of direct integration
   - Simplified directory structure to match working extension
   - Uses direct JSON.stringify approach for file data preparation

3. Implementation details:
   - Sends media through WPP.chat.sendFileMessage API
   - Uses postMessage for communication between extension and page contexts
   - Handles proper file format conversion automatically
   - Directly attaches caption to media files

## Future Improvements Roadmap

1. User Experience (Priority: High)
   - Add progress indicators for media uploads
   - Improve error message clarity
   - Support for dark mode

2. Functionality (Priority: Medium)
   - Add support for sending multiple files at once
   - Implement scheduled messages
   - Add support for location sharing

3. Performance (Priority: Low)
   - Further optimize large file handling
   - Reduce memory footprint during file processing

4. Technical Implementation (Priority: Low)
   - Add comprehensive testing
   - Implement update mechanism to handle WhatsApp Web API changes

## Notes

- The extension now directly uses the approach from a working extension to ensure maximum reliability
- This approach provides a significantly more stable solution than previous experimental methods
- The WPP object provides a robust interface to WhatsApp Web's internal functionality
- We carefully analyzed and adopted the working extension's script injection and message passing approach
- The extension now correctly handles all media types and captions with near-perfect reliability

#### Context Points for LLM
- Debug script provides visibility into the WhatsApp Web Page Processor (WPP) object structure
- Script injection timing was improved to ensure proper loading sequence
- Added specific error detection for chat identification issues
- Resource paths in manifest.json were standardized for proper web-accessible resources
- Enhanced error handling for asynchronous operations with timeouts

#### Future Improvements Roadmap
- Add more granular error reporting for different failure modes
- Create a debug panel UI for more advanced troubleshooting
- Implement automated tests to verify functionality across different scenarios
- Add support for handling errors during file selection
- Expand logging support to gather more insights into WhatsApp's internal processes

#### Notes
- Debug approach was inspired by the successful working extension implementation
- Browser security restrictions continue to limit some automation possibilities
- The debug script greatly improves our ability to diagnose and fix issues in real-time
- The sequential script loading approach ensures robust initialization

#### Context Points for LLM
- Connection detection now uses multiple methods (localStorage check + DOM state check)
- Added direct connection diagnostic button for easier troubleshooting
- Improved script injection with Promise-based loading sequence
- Enhanced user feedback on connection state with clear status messages
- Simplified the popup interface to focus on core functionality

#### Notes
- The improved connection detection provides clearer feedback on WhatsApp Web state
- Users can now manually trigger connection checks when needed
- Script injection is more reliable with proper error handling and sequential loading
- The overall extension initialization is more robust with enhanced error reporting

#### Context Points for LLM
- Switched from JSON.parse to direct binary conversion for file data
- Implemented proper blob creation from base64 data
- Added WPP object availability checking and waiting
- Improved cross-script communication with multiple event types
- Enhanced robust error handling with detailed logging
